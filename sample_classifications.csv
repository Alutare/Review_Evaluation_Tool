The men and women who deliver the fuel and the local customer service people are top notch, as is the service team. And, I love Trish--she is the best. Sadly, HOP Energy, the conglomerate that bought them does not mirror their excellence. I think the fact that these local workers UNIONIZED in response to HOP's corporate greed is why those workers are so much better than HOP itself.""}",1.0,legitimate_review,gemma3:12b

They bill you so the money isn’t needed up front. That being said, I took the initiative to call around to other oil companies after  speaking with a rep at Keyser. She was trying to get us into a plan with $3.75 being the lowest the oil cost will go. Without a plan the price of oil was $4.20/gallon. I called a local oil company and they charge $3.00/gallon. They couldn’t even believe the price gouging. One delivery would’ve cost us $300 more had we used Keyser. They should be ashamed of preying on people who just need heat.

Although there have been few, on every occasion Keyser has responded to my ""emergencies"" the same day. My last urgent call was close to 3pm on a Friday afternoon. Mike Campbell was the technician that was sent. It turned out to be a major overhaul that lasted way past quitting time on a Friday evening. We weren\'t even sure that the problem I was experiencing was related to the furnace, but he could tell that the furnace wasn\'t working properly and made it easy for me to understand why. He left me his phone number in case I had a problem over the weekend. He called and texted me throughout the next few days to make sure everything was okay. He also checked in with his supervisor during his initial visit to get his feedback on what he thought the problem might be. One thing he did that impressed me, was to leave the old parts he replaced on the workbench, so when I had to explain to my husband what he had done, all he had to do was look at the fittings on the bench to figure it out. I ran a hardware store for nearly 15 years, so I do have a basic understanding of how everything works.\n\nWhenever I call Keyser Energy I always get treated with the utmost respect. 99% of the time the technician who comes to the house for deliveries or service is polite and thorough.

He found a backup vehicle and arrived at my home to find my Garage located Oil tank Gelled up.  I had a friend come to my home to get some backup heat (space heaters,  pellet stove) going.   Mike left for a bit and came back with a 5 gal tank of fuel oil and installed a temporary feed to this tank to get the heat back on.  I arrived about 3 hours later, and Mike called and explained to me how to tend to the tank over the next day,  refilling the 5 gals every 5-6 hours until the home was back up full temp.  He suggested to Turn of the water main while home was thawing.   This prevented a major water damage issue as I did have a pipe in a known cold wall that did freeze and burst.  Mike kept checking in on me to see if I needed help and how things were going.  A few years back i had freeze up for similar issue and Mike was my technician back then.  He is a great guy to work with,  lets you know what he is doing, and cares to make sure you know what needs to be done to prevent further issues.

We were signed up for automatic delivery and we ran out of oil on the coldest weekend to date.  We called the main number and did not get an answer so I called the parent company, Dollarwise Oil, and they said someone would call me within 20 minutes.  I waited 2 hours and received no call.  I called Dollarwise again and got a call an our and a half later.  They filled our tank but when we got the bill, the price seemed inflated (called several companies in the area and they were at $2.80 that weekend and we were charged $3.49).  I called Keyser during the work week to 1) see if we were charged more because it was an emergency order (even though it wasn't our fault) and 2) what were they going to do to make sure this didn't happen again.  They admitted their prices are high and they are trying to work on it and they had given me a $25 voucher.  The customer service representative said that to ensure it not happening again, I should watch my oil gauge and let them know when it got low.  I told her I signed up for automatic refill so I would not have to watch the gauge, especially now that I have a newborn.  After sharing this information with my husband, we decided we no longer wanted to work with Keyser so I called back later in the week to discontinue being a customer.  The person answering said she would have someone call me back within the next two days to talk to me more about this.  No one ever called.  I called the end of the next week and stated my complaint and that I would no longer like to be a customer and would like them to send me a letter stating I was no longer a customer.  When I did not get such letter within a week I called again to confirm I was no longer a customer because I did not get the confirmation letter and she stated she saw the note they were suppose to send me a letter, sorry I didn't get it and that in their notes it showed I was no longer an automatic delivery customer.  I just got an email in the last couple days (this all happened about a month ago) stating it was confirming we still are an automatic delivery customer.
